<h3>Vaping Devices</h3>
The Vaper Empire line of premium vapes is home to a number of easy-to-use devices that have pleased customers across Australasia.
<br>
<br>
Vaper Empire's bespoke vaping devices include:
<br>- The Viggo Series
<br>- The Vibe Series
<br>- The V-Pack II Series
<br>- The V-Nix Series

<h4>The Viggo Pod Vape</h4>
Vape pods prefilled with premium e-juice and a compact yet powerful vape battery with variable voltage technology are hallmarks of the Viggo Series, Vaper Empire's popular pod system vape. The device is rechargeable, the vape pods are replaceable, and the battery is wrapped in a soft-touch coating that feels as good as it looks. Viggo Pods are designed to be leakage-free and connect easily to the battery, making replacement a snap. Multiple flavours of pods are available.

<h4>The Vibe Series Handheld Vape</h4>
The Vibe Series has one of the most powerful batteries of any Vaper Empire vaping device, capable of providing enough power to support its 4.5ml tank with ease. Long-lasting sessions and potent vapour are hallmarks of the Vibe Series. With the entire operation of the device controlled by one button, usage of the device is a breeze.

<h4>The V-Pack II Cig-A-Like</h4>
The early days of e-cigarettes were dominated by small vaping devices known as cig-a-likes. Today, this type of vape continues to remain popular with some vapers, however, the cig-a-like that Vaper Empire offers, the V-Pack II, is a far cry from the cig-a-likes of old. With a portable charging case to hold the battery stems and extra prefilled cartridges, the V-Pack II delivers a modern vaping experience to vapers who prefer cig-a-likes to other types of vapes. Replacement carts are prefilled with premium e-juice and are available in multiple flavours, as well as different nicotine strengths.

<h4>The V-Nix Series Vape Pen</h4>
Refillable and rechargeable, the V-Nix Series vaping device is the best vape pen that Vaper Empire has ever offered. This premium vaping pen has all of the adjustments needed to customise the vapour that it produces. There is an adjustable airflow collar right below the tank and three wattage settings to choose from. By adjusting the airflow and wattage, the density, smoothness, temperature, and abundance of vapour that the V-Nix produces can be calibrated to fit the user's preference. With replaceable coils, a rechargeable battery, and a refillable tank, the V-Nix aims to be a long-lasting device capable of pleasing vapers for an extended period of time.
